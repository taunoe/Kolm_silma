### Doppler Effect

* Discovered in 1842 by Christian Doppler.
* Change in frequency observed when source is moving.
* Applies to all waves: light, sound, radio and water waves.
* Astronomy - red or blue shifting of light from distant object.
* Satellite communications -used dynamic doppler compensation.
* Medical -echocardiogram measures blood flow.
